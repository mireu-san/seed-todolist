Tech note:
- npm i react-beautiful-dnd & npm i @types/react-beautiful-dnd
- (this will allow drag and drop feature, just like how survey website does)

Personal note:
Remember, wrap it up. See how the logics flow.
Be sure to (1)drag and (2)drop, design two actions specially.

# Almost found where to knock, but no idea how:
- useState will surely let 'handleDone' to also change that icon.
icon for done is from react-icon.
- To let it change, it may be necessary to just create another useState variable.
- Maybe coding a new useState 'in' the present useState is wrong idea.
